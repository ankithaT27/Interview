Track the changes that have staged but not committed:
$ git diff --staged

track the changes in the staging area (files that have been changed)
$ git diff 

Git, let us track the changes after committing a file. Suppose we have committed a file for the repository and made some additional changes after the commit. So we can track the file on this stage also.
$ git diff HEAD
